# ToutDoux
A simple ToDo list

## Build 
You can build thhis project using cmake (MSVC is not supported in the options (I haven't test it))

The bin folder contains a folder "projets" which contains files used/produced by ToutDoux.

## Run
When ToutDoux is launched from the command line, the project folder will be a subfolder of your working directory named "projets".
